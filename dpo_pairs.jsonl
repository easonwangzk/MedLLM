Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates.\n- A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age ≥55 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, age ≥55 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were associated.

Adolescents (n = 852) completed a questionnaire asking for sports participation, perceived NSC and demographics. Ecometric methods were used to aggregate perceived NSC to zip code level. Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social environmental factors and leisure time sports participation. Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects.\n- NSC was significantly associated with sports participation (OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.18;10.41)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found. Decomposition of the interaction term showed that adolescents were most likely to engage in leisure time sports when both availability of parks and NSC were highest.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22849512", "type": "ynm"}}

The patient has HIV nephropathy and adrenal insufficiency. He takes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP prophylaxis and is on triple-agent antiretroviral treatment. He was recently started on spironolactone for ascites due to alcoholic liver disease. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs, but his muscles are diffusely weak. Frequent extrasystoles are noted. He has mild ascites and 1+ peripheral edema. Laboratory studies show a serum creatinine of 2.5 with a potassium value of 7.3 mEq/L. ECG shows peaking of the T-waves and QRS widening to 0.14.Once the patient is stabilized and the T-waves have normalized, it is important to review the potential causes of his hyperkalemia and to take steps to prevent this from happening again. As you consider the pathophysiology of each confounding factor, which of the following statements is true?\n\nOptions:\nA. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which this patient was taking to prevent Pneumocystis infection, causes hypokalemia and therefore deterred this patient from presenting sooner.\nB. Spironolactone, a commonly used diuretic for treating ascites in the setting of cirrhosis, acts as a competitive aldosterone inhibitor at the level of the collecting duct of the nephron, resulting in decreased potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.\nC. This patient most likely had pseudo-hyperkalemia due to the use of a very small needle as well as rough handling of the specimen as it was transported to the laboratory, both of which caused hemolysis and release of potassium into the serum\nD. Once this patient is hospitalized he will likely receive heparin for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis. Heparin should help ameliorate the hyperkalemia in the ensuing days in the hospital.\n\nAnswer with ONLY ONE LETTER from [ABCD].\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "B", "rejected": "A", "meta": {"dataset": "MedMCQA", "id": "e280779d-9e20-4198-b368-c1c697a249bb", "type": "mcq"}}

Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested.\n- During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.\n- Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11776681", "type": "ynm"}}

It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL.\n- The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p>0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results.\n- The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p>0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p<0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p>0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p>0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p>0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p>0.05).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21361755", "type": "ynm"}}

A secondary objective was to determine the proportion of EMS professionals who had participated in disease prevention programs.\n- As part of the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians' biennial reregistration process, EMS professionals reregistering in 2006 were asked to complete an optional survey regarding their opinions on and participation in disease and injury prevention. Demographic characteristics were also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 99% confidence intervals (CIs). The chi-square test was used to compare differences by responder demographics (alpha = 0.01). A 10% difference between groups was determined to be clinically significant.\n- The survey was completed by 27,233 EMS professionals. Of these responders, 82.7% (99% CI: 82.1-83.3) felt that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention, with those working 20 to 29 hours per week being the least likely to think they should participate (67.4%, p<0.001). About a third, 33.8% (99% CI: 33.1-34.6), of the respondents reported having provided prevention services, with those having a graduate degree (43.5%, p<0.001), those working in EMS for more than 21 years (44%, p<0.001), those working for the military (57%, p<0.001), those working 60 to 69 hours per week (41%, p<0.001), and those responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week (43%, p<0.001) being the most likely to report having provided prevention services. About half, 51.1% (99% CI: 50.4-51.9), of the respondents agreed that prevention services should be provided during emergency calls, and 7.7% (99% CI: 7.3-8.1) of the respondents reported providing prevention services during emergency calls. No demographic differences existed. Those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to respond that EMS professionals should participate in prevention (92% vs. 82%, p<0.001). Further, those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during emergency calls (81% vs. 51%, p<0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "19145527", "type": "ynm"}}

The associations of AMD and polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied.\n- Prospective study.\n- Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) had dry type AMD.\n- Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by dye-termination DNA sequencing.\n- Genotype distribution of rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between genotypes and AMD subtypes.\n- Given the significant difference between the mean age of case and control groups (72.13 ± 5.77 vs. 62.80 ± 5.22, respectively) (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy subjects.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "24995509", "type": "ynm"}}

Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI.\n- Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI.\n- The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In both databases, VHRS, VHWG, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overestimated risk of SSO and SSI, whereas HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated risk for all groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "27338535", "type": "ynm"}}

Meropenem (500 mg) was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area of 1.05 m2 and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations were measured on 2 days of treatment (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using microdialysis.\n- A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9 (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively.

Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles.\n- We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles.\n- Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06).

Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur early within the SK.\n- Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK.\n- A cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK (mean age 56.44 ± 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 ± 9.37 years), 19 patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 ± 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured.\n- In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients.

We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy.\n- Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated.\n- In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21431987", "type": "ynm"}}

This disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men).\n- To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men.\n- This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of<198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM.\n- A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those>70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "19481382", "type": "ynm"}}

Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.\n- All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21801416", "type": "ynm"}}

The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit 2 weeks ago because of septic shock related to alcoholism, pneumonia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. He had developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as acute kidney injury. His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL.

Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.\n- Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.\n- Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term.

It is not clear whether the K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol are adequate for correction of VDDI and hyperparathyroidism.\n- Retrospective study of 88 patients with CKD Stages 1 - 5 and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level<30 ng/ml (<75 nmol/l). Patients treated with ergocalciferol as recommended by K/DOQI guidelines. Only 53 patients had elevated baseline PTH level for the CKD stage. Patients were excluded if they received vitamin D preparations other than ergocalciferol or phosphate binders. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, intact PTH level (iPTH), and other parameters of mineral metabolism were measured at baseline and after completion of ergocalciferol course.\n- 88 patients with CKD were treated with ergocalciferol. Mean age 56.8 +/- 9.5 years and 41% were males. The mean (+/- SD) GFR was 28.3 +/- 16.6 ml/min. At the end of the 6-month period of ergocalciferol treatment, the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increased from 15.1 +/- 5.8 to 23.3 +/- 11.8 ng/ml (37.75 +/- 14.5 to 58.25 +/- 29.5 nmol/l) (p<0.001).

On the other hand, there are no published studies related to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in this patient group. Our aim was to assess the effect of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients.\n- Twelve patients (ten males and two females, age 67.1 ± 7.2 years) with newly diagnosed IPF and moderate to severe OSA, confirmed by overnight attended polysomnography, were included. Therapy with CPAP was initiated after a formal in-lab CPAP titration study. The patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at CPAP initiation and after 1, 3, and 6 months of effective CPAP therapy.\n- A statistically significant improvement was observed in the FOSQ at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation (baseline 12.9 ± 2.9 vs. 14.7 ± 2.6 vs. 15.8 ± 2.1 vs. 16.9 ± 1.9, respectively, p = 0.02). Improvement, although not statistically significant, was noted in ESS score (9.2 ± 5.6 vs. 7.6 ± 4.9 vs. 7.5 ± 5.3 vs. 7.7 ± 5.2, p = 0.84), PSQI (10.7 ± 4.4 vs. 10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.7 vs. 8.6 ± 5.2, p = 0.66), FSS (39.5 ± 10.2 vs. 34.8 ± 8.5 vs. 33.6 ± 10.7 vs. 33.4 ± 10.9, p = 0.44), SF-36 (63.2 ± 13.9 vs. 68.9 ± 13.5 vs. 72.1 ± 12.9 vs. 74.4 ± 11.3, p = 0.27), and BDI (12.9 ± 5.5 vs. 10.7 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.8 vs. 9.6 ± 4.5, p = 0.40). Two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP for a variety of reasons (nocturnal cough, claustrophobia, insomnia) and stopped CPAP use after the first month, despite intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff. Heated humidification was added for all patients in order to improve the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "23386371", "type": "ynm"}}

However, the criteria used in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of resident performance by faculty.QUESTIONS/\n- Do preresidency selection factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty.\n- Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate.\n- Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.55, p<0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 0.45, p<0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the \"interpersonal and communication skills\" subsection of the global evaluations.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25940336", "type": "ynm"}}

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.\n- In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.\n- In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113±41 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08±0.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2±2.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21900017", "type": "ynm"}}

The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship.\n- A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "23999452", "type": "ynm"}}

A secondary objective was to determine the proportion of EMS professionals who had participated in disease prevention programs.\n- As part of the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians' biennial reregistration process, EMS professionals reregistering in 2006 were asked to complete an optional survey regarding their opinions on and participation in disease and injury prevention. Demographic characteristics were also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 99% confidence intervals (CIs). The chi-square test was used to compare differences by responder demographics (alpha = 0.01). A 10% difference between groups was determined to be clinically significant.\n- The survey was completed by 27,233 EMS professionals. Of these responders, 82.7% (99% CI: 82.1-83.3) felt that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention, with those working 20 to 29 hours per week being the least likely to think they should participate (67.4%, p<0.001). About a third, 33.8% (99% CI: 33.1-34.6), of the respondents reported having provided prevention services, with those having a graduate degree (43.5%, p<0.001), those working in EMS for more than 21 years (44%, p<0.001), those working for the military (57%, p<0.001), those working 60 to 69 hours per week (41%, p<0.001), and those responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week (43%, p<0.001) being the most likely to report having provided prevention services. About half, 51.1% (99% CI: 50.4-51.9), of the respondents agreed that prevention services should be provided during emergency calls, and 7.7% (99% CI: 7.3-8.1) of the respondents reported providing prevention services during emergency calls. No demographic differences existed. Those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to respond that EMS professionals should participate in prevention (92% vs. 82%, p<0.001). Further, those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during emergency calls (81% vs. 51%, p<0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "19145527", "type": "ynm"}}

All patients treated for hypertension visiting the health centre on a specific day of the week and during the same timetable between October 2000 and May 2001 were included.\n- The difference between physician-systolic BP and nurse-systolic BP was 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001). The difference between physician-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP was 4.67 mmHg (95% CI 0.89-8.44; p=0.016). The differences between nurse-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP were not significant (0.49 mmHg; 95% CI 3.71-2.71; p=0.758). With regards to diastolic BP, no significant differences were found between the different ways of measurement. NBP gave the following values: sensitivity (Sn) of 92% and specificity (Sp) of 60%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 65.7% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% with a positive coefficient of probability (CP+) of 2.3 and a negative coefficient of probability (CP-) of 0.133.

Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates.\n- A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age ≥55 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, age ≥55 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were associated. ETA was not a significant predictor in both analyses.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25982163", "type": "ynm"}}

However, the criteria used in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of resident performance by faculty.QUESTIONS/\n- Do preresidency selection factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty.\n- Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate.\n- Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.55, p<0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 0.45, p<0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the \"interpersonal and communication skills\" subsection of the global evaluations.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25940336", "type": "ynm"}}

Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear.\n- Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation.\n- SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21946341", "type": "ynm"}}

Of 170 patients, 48 were cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline differences.\n- The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p<0.01) was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p<0.01) and age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p<0.01) and comorbidity score (p<0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p = 0.21).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "12098035", "type": "ynm"}}

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?\n\nOptions:\nA. There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms.\nB. There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms.\nC. Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.\nD.

Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested.\n- During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.\n- Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11776681", "type": "ynm"}}

Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur early within the SK.\n- Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK.\n- A cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK (mean age 56.44 ± 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 ± 9.37 years), 19 patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 ± 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured.\n- In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients. Inverse correlation with eGFR presented NAG (R(2 )= 0.537, p = 0.022), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.702, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.655, p = 0.003). In congenital SK, NAG increased in 52.63%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 5.26%, albuminuria in 47.36% of patients. In this group, urinary biomarkers correlated inversely with eGFR: NAG (R(2 )= 0.743, p < 0.001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin (R(2 )= 0.701, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.821, p < 0.001).

The health experiences of these groups are recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred outcomes that includes place of death (PoD).AIM: To examine patterns in PoD among BAME groups who died of cancer.\n- Mortality data for 93,375 cancer deaths of those aged ≥65 years in London from 2001-2010 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the association between country of birth and place of death.\n- 76% decedents were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained.

Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?\n\nEvidence:\n- The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.\n- Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.\n- Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22382608", "type": "ynm"}}

The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.\n- Compared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks. Among HBR patients, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 22.6% of the E-ZES and 29% of the BMS patients (hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033), driven by lower myocardial infarction (3.5% vs. 10.4%; p<0.001) and target vessel revascularization (5.9% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.005) rates in the E-ZES arm.

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001). Gynecomastia was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1% of men in the placebo group (p<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?\n\nOptions:\nA. Spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure\nB. The addition of spironolactone significant improved symptoms of heart failure, but not overall mortality\nC. Spironolactone did not improve all-cause morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure\nD.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005).

Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/\n- This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.\n- Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.\n- At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "26194560", "type": "ynm"}}

Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation).\n- Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations. Prior to enrolling, participants were not given any additional training on ventilation skills.\n- We enrolled 50 providers from a large, busy, urban fire-based EMS agency with 14.96 (SD = 9.92) mean years of experience. Only 1.5% of all breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM during the ventilation scenarios were below the recommended tidal volume. A greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the pediatric BVM was used (17.5% vs 5.1%, p<0.001). Median volumes for each scenario were 570.5mL, 664.0mL, 663.0mL for the pediatric BMV and 796.0mL, 994.5mL, 981.5mL for the adult BVM. In all three categories of airway devices, the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes (p<0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "27690714", "type": "ynm"}}

Summary estimates were constructed using a DerSimonian-Laird model. Seventeen trials with 20 960 patients were available for analysis. When compared with conventional PCI, aspiration thrombectomy was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of mortality 2.8% versus 3.2% (risk ratio [RR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.04; P=0.13), reinfarction 1.3% versus 1.4% (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.17; P=0.52), the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction 4.1% versus 4.6% (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.02; P=0.11), or stent thrombosis 0.9% versus 1.2% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.08; P=0.15). Aspiration thrombectomy was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the risk of stroke 0.6% versus 0.4% (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.96-2.21; P=0.08). Meta-regression analysis did not identify a difference for the log RR of mortality, reinfarction, and the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction with intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (P=0.17, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively) or with ischemic time (P=0.29, 0.66, and 0.58, respectively).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "26175531", "type": "ynm"}}

The patient has HIV nephropathy and adrenal insufficiency. He takes trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP prophylaxis and is on triple-agent antiretroviral treatment. He was recently started on spironolactone for ascites due to alcoholic liver disease. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs, but his muscles are diffusely weak. Frequent extrasystoles are noted. He has mild ascites and 1+ peripheral edema. Laboratory studies show a serum creatinine of 2.5 with a potassium value of 7.3 mEq/L. ECG shows peaking of the T-waves and QRS widening to 0.14.Once the patient is stabilized and the T-waves have normalized, it is important to review the potential causes of his hyperkalemia and to take steps to prevent this from happening again. As you consider the pathophysiology of each confounding factor, which of the following statements is true?\n\nOptions:\nA. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which this patient was taking to prevent Pneumocystis infection, causes hypokalemia and therefore deterred this patient from presenting sooner.\nB. Spironolactone, a commonly used diuretic for treating ascites in the setting of cirrhosis, acts as a competitive aldosterone inhibitor at the level of the collecting duct of the nephron, resulting in decreased potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.\nC.

Of 170 patients, 48 were cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline differences.\n- The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p<0.01) was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p<0.01) and age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p<0.01) and comorbidity score (p<0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p = 0.21).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "12098035", "type": "ynm"}}

The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the preoperative echocardiogram. Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement. Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. Only ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MV repair group (0.308 ± 0.077 vs 0.336 ± 0.076, p = 0.04).\n- Hospital mortality was 2.3% for MV repair and 12.5% for MV replacement (p = 0.03). Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 ± 3.2% for MV repair and 73 ± 7.9% for MV replacement (p = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 ± 0.077 to 0.382 ± 0.095, p<0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 0.0001). On the other hand, in the MV replacement group LVEF did not significantly change (from 0.336 ± 0.076 to 0.31 ± 0.11, p = 0.56) and the reduction of LV dimensions was not significant. Mitral valve replacement was identified as the only predictor of hospital (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22440363", "type": "ynm"}}

Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.\n- Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.\n- Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart.

Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT?\n\nEvidence:\n- This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy.\n- Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated.\n- In a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients.

To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion.\n- In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR.\n- In the IR group, total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline (113±41 ml min\"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn (0.08±0.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2±2.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable range for both the groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21900017", "type": "ynm"}}

We, therefore, explored health behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal blood pressure (BP) (≤ 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the development of hypertension.\n- The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included African volunteers (n = 1994; aged>30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households in rural and urban areas.\n- At baseline, 48% of the participants were hypertensive (≥ 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and greater amount of γ-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)]at baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline γ-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, β = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [β = 0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)]and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated with increased BP.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22825590", "type": "ynm"}}

The health experiences of these groups are recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred outcomes that includes place of death (PoD).AIM: To examine patterns in PoD among BAME groups who died of cancer.\n- Mortality data for 93,375 cancer deaths of those aged ≥65 years in London from 2001-2010 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the association between country of birth and place of death.\n- 76% decedents were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained.

Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles.\n- We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles.\n- Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06).

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.\n- An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.\n- A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22453060", "type": "ynm"}}

We, therefore, explored health behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal blood pressure (BP) (≤ 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the development of hypertension.\n- The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included African volunteers (n = 1994; aged>30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households in rural and urban areas.\n- At baseline, 48% of the participants were hypertensive (≥ 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and greater amount of γ-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)]at baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline γ-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, β = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [β = 0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)]and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated with increased BP.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22825590", "type": "ynm"}}

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\n\nOptions:\nA.

This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker.\n- DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed.\n- Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p<0.001), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), UICC TNM stage (p<0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p<0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p<0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25604390", "type": "ynm"}}

In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group.\n- We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1 week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure.\n- Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0 kg/m(2)), 52 % of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 15), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8 cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r = 0.34, p = 0.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r = 0.48, p < 0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "26449554", "type": "ynm"}}

The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the preoperative echocardiogram. Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement. Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. Only ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MV repair group (0.308 ± 0.077 vs 0.336 ± 0.076, p = 0.04).\n- Hospital mortality was 2.3% for MV repair and 12.5% for MV replacement (p = 0.03). Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 ± 3.2% for MV repair and 73 ± 7.9% for MV replacement (p = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 ± 0.077 to 0.382 ± 0.095, p<0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 0.0001). On the other hand, in the MV replacement group LVEF did not significantly change (from 0.336 ± 0.076 to 0.31 ± 0.11, p = 0.56) and the reduction of LV dimensions was not significant. Mitral valve replacement was identified as the only predictor of hospital (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22440363", "type": "ynm"}}

It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL.\n- The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p>0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results.\n- The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p>0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p<0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p>0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p>0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p>0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p>0.05).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21361755", "type": "ynm"}}

However, these studies are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and future HRQoL.\n- The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL.\n- This is a population-based cohort study.\n- Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included.\n- Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire.\n- We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25499207", "type": "ynm"}}

The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents.\n- Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS).\n- Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11943048", "type": "ynm"}}

We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0 mm.\n- The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 ± 0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 ± 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively.

However, these studies are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and future HRQoL.\n- The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL.\n- This is a population-based cohort study.\n- Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included.\n- Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire.\n- We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25499207", "type": "ynm"}}

Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.\n- All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21801416", "type": "ynm"}}

She says that her breathlessness is getting worse, and the chest pain is especially severe when she takes a deep breath. The patient denies any similar symptoms in the past. Her past medical history is insignificant except for occasional heartburn. She currently does not take any medication. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. She denies the use of any illicit drugs including marijuana. Vital signs are: blood pressure 122/78 mm Hg, pulse 67/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). Her physical examination is remarkable for diminished chest expansion on the left side, absence of breath sounds at the left lung base, and dullness to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus on the left. A plain radiograph of the chest reveals a large left-sided pleural effusion occupying almost two-thirds of the left lung field.

On the other hand, there are no published studies related to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in this patient group. Our aim was to assess the effect of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients.\n- Twelve patients (ten males and two females, age 67.1 ± 7.2 years) with newly diagnosed IPF and moderate to severe OSA, confirmed by overnight attended polysomnography, were included. Therapy with CPAP was initiated after a formal in-lab CPAP titration study. The patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at CPAP initiation and after 1, 3, and 6 months of effective CPAP therapy.\n- A statistically significant improvement was observed in the FOSQ at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation (baseline 12.9 ± 2.9 vs. 14.7 ± 2.6 vs. 15.8 ± 2.1 vs. 16.9 ± 1.9, respectively, p = 0.02). Improvement, although not statistically significant, was noted in ESS score (9.2 ± 5.6 vs. 7.6 ± 4.9 vs. 7.5 ± 5.3 vs. 7.7 ± 5.2, p = 0.84), PSQI (10.7 ± 4.4 vs. 10.1 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.7 vs. 8.6 ± 5.2, p = 0.66), FSS (39.5 ± 10.2 vs. 34.8 ± 8.5 vs. 33.6 ± 10.7 vs. 33.4 ± 10.9, p = 0.44), SF-36 (63.2 ± 13.9 vs. 68.9 ± 13.5 vs. 72.1 ± 12.9 vs. 74.4 ± 11.3, p = 0.27), and BDI (12.9 ± 5.5 vs. 10.7 ± 4.3 vs. 9.4 ± 4.8 vs. 9.6 ± 4.5, p = 0.40). Two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP for a variety of reasons (nocturnal cough, claustrophobia, insomnia) and stopped CPAP use after the first month, despite intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff. Heated humidification was added for all patients in order to improve the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "23386371", "type": "ynm"}}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-β1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression.\n- This prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-β1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression.\n- The score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-β1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-β1 in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008). There was a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and TGF-β1 (Spearman's correlation P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21726930", "type": "ynm"}}

Adolescents (n = 852) completed a questionnaire asking for sports participation, perceived NSC and demographics. Ecometric methods were used to aggregate perceived NSC to zip code level. Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social environmental factors and leisure time sports participation. Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects.\n- NSC was significantly associated with sports participation (OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.18;10.41)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found. Decomposition of the interaction term showed that adolescents were most likely to engage in leisure time sports when both availability of parks and NSC were highest.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22849512", "type": "ynm"}}

Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.\n- Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11380492", "type": "ynm"}}

Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, reported revision rates for loosening are high.QUESTIONS/\n- This study measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction.\n- Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans.\n- At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3° (range, 0.1°-7.4°). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "26194560", "type": "ynm"}}

Calculations of positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed in all four sacral sparing criteria. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) ratios of all regression equations was calculated.\n- To achieve independent ambulation 1-year post injury, a normal S4-5 PP score showed the best PPV (96.5%, P<0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 87.9-99.6). Best NPV was reported in the S4-5 LT score (91.7%, P<0.001, 95% CI: 81.6-97.2). The use of the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better (P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.038-0.128) discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.781-0.864).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "maybe", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "19468282", "type": "ynm"}}

It is not clear whether the K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol are adequate for correction of VDDI and hyperparathyroidism.\n- Retrospective study of 88 patients with CKD Stages 1 - 5 and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level<30 ng/ml (<75 nmol/l). Patients treated with ergocalciferol as recommended by K/DOQI guidelines. Only 53 patients had elevated baseline PTH level for the CKD stage. Patients were excluded if they received vitamin D preparations other than ergocalciferol or phosphate binders. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, intact PTH level (iPTH), and other parameters of mineral metabolism were measured at baseline and after completion of ergocalciferol course.\n- 88 patients with CKD were treated with ergocalciferol.

Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.\n- Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11380492", "type": "ynm"}}

The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship.\n- A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "23999452", "type": "ynm"}}

We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0 mm.\n- The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 ± 0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 ± 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22227642", "type": "ynm"}}

Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?\n\nEvidence:\n- The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.\n- Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.\n- Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22382608", "type": "ynm"}}

Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?\"\n\"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\nMajor Depressive Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Bipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis Any Psychotic Disorder\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value\nControl 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] --\nAfterschool Enrichment 0.69 (0.59–0.87) < 0.001 0.80 (0.74–0.92) 0.02 0.64 (0.59–1.35) 0.34 0.84 (0.51–1.23) 0.22\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\"\n\nOptions:\nA. High-quality afterschool programming has a greater effect on reducing ADHD risk in adults than major depressive disorder risk.\nB.

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.\n- An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.\n- A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "22453060", "type": "ynm"}}

Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate of SSO and SSI.\n- Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI.\n- The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In both databases, VHRS, VHWG, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overestimated risk of SSO and SSI, whereas HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated risk for all groups.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "27338535", "type": "ynm"}}

Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear.\n- Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation.\n- SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "yes", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "21946341", "type": "ynm"}}

Meropenem (500 mg) was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area of 1.05 m2 and a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations were measured on 2 days of treatment (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using microdialysis.\n- A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak concentrations were 13.6 (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 (2.4-3.4) and 4.9 (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively.

The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents.\n- Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS).\n- Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "11943048", "type": "ynm"}}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-β1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression.\n- This prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-β1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression.\n- The score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-β1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-β1 in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008).

Secondary outcomes included: duration of mechanical ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), post-natal steroids for CLD and major neonatal morbidities.\n- Premature infants born at 22-32 weeks' gestation between January 2006 and December 2009.\n- Ten neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia.\n- Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the regional NICU database in NSW and ACT.\n- Of the 2170 infants who received surfactant, 1182 (54.5%) and 988 (45.5%) received early and late surfactant, respectively.

Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?\"\n\"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health\nBackground\nHigh-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.\n160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.\nInterventions\nThe intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nData on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.\nResults\nTable - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.\n*Adjusted for income and family history of psychiatric illness.\nMajor Depressive Disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Bipolar Disorder (I or II) without Psychosis Any Psychotic Disorder\nHazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value Hazard Ratio (95% CI) P -value\nControl 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] -- 1.0 [reference] --\nAfterschool Enrichment 0.69 (0.59–0.87) < 0.001 0.80 (0.74–0.92) 0.02 0.64 (0.59–1.35) 0.34 0.84 (0.51–1.23) 0.22\nConclusions\nThis study highlights the potential of high-quality afterschool programming during childhood in promoting long-term adult mental health.\nSource of funding: Wisconsin Children's Mental Health Foundation, National Early Childhood Education Coalition\"\n\nOptions:\nA. High-quality afterschool programming has a greater effect on reducing ADHD risk in adults than major depressive disorder risk.\nB. The patient's family history of psychiatric illness prevents any conclusions from being drawn from the study.\nC. High-quality afterschool programming would decrease this patient's risk of developing major depressive disorder.\nD. High-quality afterschool programming has a greater effect on reducing psychotic disorder risk in adults than bipolar disorder risk.\nE. High-quality afterschool programming for low-income 8-year-olds may correlate with decreased ADHD risk in adults.\n\nAnswer with ONLY ONE LETTER from [ABCDE].\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "E", "rejected": "A", "meta": {"dataset": "MedQA", "id": "7664", "type": "mcq"}}

He got this wound accidentally when he felt unwell and went out to his garden \"to catch some air\". He reports he had been treated for tetanus 35 years ago and has received the Tdap vaccine several times since then, but he does not remember when he last received the vaccine. His vital signs are as follows: the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 91/min, respiratory rate is 19/min, and temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). On physical examination, he is mildly dyspneic and pale. Lung auscultation reveals diminished vesicular breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally with a few inspiratory crackles heard over the left lower lobe. There is a puncture wound 1 cm in diameter that is contaminated with soil in the middle third of the patient’s shin. You order blood tests and an X-ray, and now you are arranging his wound treatment. How should tetanus post-exposure prevention be performed in this case?\n\nOptions:\nA. The patient should only be administered human tetanus immunoglobulin, because he is acutely ill and febrile, which are contraindications for tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine administration.\nB. The patient does not need tetanus post-exposure prevention, because he has a past medical history of tetanus.\nC. The patient does not need tetanus post-exposure prevention, because he received the Tdap vaccine several times in the past.\nD.

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\n\nOptions:\nA. An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nB. A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy\nC.

This disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men).\n- To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men.\n- This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of<198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM.\n- A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those>70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "no", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "19481382", "type": "ynm"}}

Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed.\n- Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p<0.001), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), UICC TNM stage (p<0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p<0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p<0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients.\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "25604390", "type": "ynm"}}

In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group.\n- We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1 week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure.\n- Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0 kg/m(2)), 52 % of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 15), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8 cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI r = 0.34, p = 0.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r = 0.48, p < 0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "26449554", "type": "ynm"}}

All patients treated for hypertension visiting the health centre on a specific day of the week and during the same timetable between October 2000 and May 2001 were included.\n- The difference between physician-systolic BP and nurse-systolic BP was 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001). The difference between physician-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP was 4.67 mmHg (95% CI 0.89-8.44; p=0.016). The differences between nurse-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP were not significant (0.49 mmHg; 95% CI 3.71-2.71; p=0.758). With regards to diastolic BP, no significant differences were found between the different ways of measurement. NBP gave the following values: sensitivity (Sn) of 92% and specificity (Sp) of 60%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 65.7% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% with a positive coefficient of probability (CP+) of 2.3 and a negative coefficient of probability (CP-) of 0.133.

The patient had been admitted to the intensive care unit 2 weeks ago because of septic shock related to alcoholism, pneumonia, and Klebsiella bacteremia. He had developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation as well as acute kidney injury. His pulmonary infiltrates had responded to appropriate intravenous antibiotics and his hypotension had responded to intravenous norepinephrine. Now the patient is alert and responsive to verbal commands, is afebrile with blood pressure of 114/74 but has not tolerated several trials of weaning from the ventilator. On physical examination, the patient is cooperative. Cranial nerves are normal. Muscle strength is poor, especially in distal musculature, where he displays only 2/5 strength in the hands and feet. Proximal strength is 3/5. Ankle and knee reflexes are unobtainable. Sensory examination is difficult because of problems communicating with the patient but suggests distal sensory loss in the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show that his creatinine level has spontaneously improved to 2.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are normal, and the patient has a mild normochromic normocytic anemia with resolving leukocytosis. Serum creatine kinase is 78 units/L (normal <140).

The associations of AMD and polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied.\n- Prospective study.\n- Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) had dry type AMD.\n- Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by dye-termination DNA sequencing.\n- Genotype distribution of rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between genotypes and AMD subtypes.\n- Given the significant difference between the mean age of case and control groups (72.13 ± 5.77 vs. 62.80 ± 5.22, respectively) (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83).

Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation).\n- Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations. Prior to enrolling, participants were not given any additional training on ventilation skills.\n- We enrolled 50 providers from a large, busy, urban fire-based EMS agency with 14.96 (SD = 9.92) mean years of experience. Only 1.5% of all breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM during the ventilation scenarios were below the recommended tidal volume. A greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the pediatric BVM was used (17.5% vs 5.1%, p<0.001). Median volumes for each scenario were 570.5mL, 664.0mL, 663.0mL for the pediatric BMV and 796.0mL, 994.5mL, 981.5mL for the adult BVM. In all three categories of airway devices, the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes (p<0.001).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "no", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "27690714", "type": "ynm"}}

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001). Gynecomastia was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1% of men in the placebo group (p<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nWhich of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial?\n\nOptions:\nA. Spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure\nB. The addition of spironolactone significant improved symptoms of heart failure, but not overall mortality\nC. Spironolactone did not improve all-cause morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure\nD. The incidence of both gynecomastia and hyperkalemia was elevated in patients treated with spironolactone\nE. Given the large sample size of this clinical trial, the results are likelily generalizable to all patient with heart failure\n\nAnswer with ONLY ONE LETTER from [ABCDE].\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "A", "rejected": "C", "meta": {"dataset": "MedQA", "id": "2040", "type": "mcq"}}

The control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see.\n- Attitude of current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months.\n- Among non-smokers, 47.8% of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54).\n\nAnswer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "chosen": "yes", "rejected": "maybe", "meta": {"dataset": "PubMedQA", "id": "17565137", "type": "ynm"}}
